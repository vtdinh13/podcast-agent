Many of us think of sleep as if it's like a light switch, that we just jump into bed, and when we turn the light out, sleep should arrive in that same way. To the binary, you know, it's on or it's off. Sleep is a physiological process. It's much more like landing a plane. It takes time to gradually descend down onto the terra firmer of what we call good solid sleep at night. Find out whatever works for you, and it could be light stretching.

So what cognitive behavior of therapy does is it essentially increases your sleep hygiene. So there are certain just general rules. So have a regular bedtime and a regular arousal time. Don't be skipping back and forth all the time. Arousal, you mean wake up time? Wake up time. Yeah. Spoken like a true physio. Another thing is don't use screens within a couple hours of bedtime because screens are predominantly rich in blue light and what that does is you mentioned the circadian system. That affects your circadian system. That pushes off your circadian stimulus for sleep. Another thing is, of course, relax. Don't work right up till the time you're going to bed.

The principle reason that if you look at insomnia as a physiological condition or current working model mechanistically of how insomnia plays out is that you are in this state of almost low level anxiety. And you are somewhat stressed. And when you go to sleep or you try to go to sleep or you wake back up and you're trying to get back to sleep, you just have this role effects of anxiety.

This is something that is used in the probably the most well validated psychological intervention for insomnia. And it's called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia or CBTI for short. What happens is that you work with a clinician, they interview you, they assess all of the reasons that you may not be sleeping. And then they create from their toolbox of many different options, a bespoke tailored sort of several row soup prescription for you for your treatment.

Turns out that most everybody feels the impulse to sleep in on the weekend, especially if it's been out late the night before. However, the data show that keeping relatively consistent sleep and wake times is really going to enhance the quality and depth of your sleep. So if you stay out late one night, sure you might allow yourself to sleep in an extra hour or so but you should really try it to avoid sleeping in longer than an hour beyond your normal wake-up time.

And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually has to increase about 1 to 3 degrees. Eight sleep makes it very easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment, by allowing you to program the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning, middle, and end of the night. I've been sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover for nearly 4 years now, and it has completely transformed and improved the quality of my sleep. Eight sleep recently launched their newest generation of the pod cover called the pod for ultra. The pod for ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity.

Episode three gets into the power of Naps, caffeine, food, and the timing of those. Oh, so powerful. Episode four gets into the role of sleep in learning, memory, and creativity. What's more interesting than that? Episode five, we discussed sleep and its impact\"\n",

So I think other suggestions I would have after do nothing would be try to think about limiting your time and bed if you are struggling with sleep. This is something that is used in the probably the most well validated psychological intervention for insomnia. And it's called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia or CBTI for short. What happens is that you work with a clinician, they interview you, they assess all of the reasons that you may not be sleeping. And then they create from their toolbox of many different options, a bespoke tailored sort of several row soup prescription for you for your treatment. If you look at the studies of that collection of different tools in the CBTI box for intervention of insomnia. And you ask of all of those, which seems to carry the greatest impact on insomnia,\"\n",

The first one, which is unconventional along with lines of naps, if you've had a bad night of sleep, do nothing. What I mean by that is, don't wake up any later, don't sleep in the following day to try and make up for it. Don't nap during the day. Don't consume extra caffeine to wake you up, to try to get you through the day, and don't go to bed any earlier to think that you're going to compensate.

We will touch on some of the underlying science, but it's really designed to be a practical tool kit for optimizing your sleep depending on your specific sleep needs. Various times throughout today's episode, I will refer to studies that form the backbone of the tools that I'll be describing. But whereas most of the podcast episodes here tend to be deep scientific mechanism and then tools scientific mechanism and then tools today, I'm mainly going to focus on the practical tools that anyone indeed all people I believe should use in order to optimize their sleep.

I don't like the one and I know you don't either or hacks or these are protocols and they're well informed scientific protocols. In all of this discussion today, you can get all of these things in place and still have problems with sleep. The reason is because you may be suffering from a sleep disorder.

I can perfect everything I can perfect your, your diet, your supplements, we can perfect your technique, we can perfect.

The next piece of scientific data that I'm going to describe is a very important piece of scientific data for sake of understanding how to optimize your brain and access sleep. It also can help and avoid a lot of anxiety issues. And these relate to data from Charles Isler, Dr. He's an MD, Chuck's Isler's lab at Harvard Medical School. He's run a sleep lab out of Harvard Medical School for a long time now, does very impressive work. And what he's shown is that the peak output of the circadian clock for wakefulness, in other words, the peak of our wakefulness and the suppression of the sleep signal actually happens very late in the day.

So, for instance, you can cool your mattress if you tend to run warm, and that will help you fall and stay deeply asleep. And then, toward morning, you can have the mattress programmed, or that I should say the mattress cover program, so that you warm up your sleeping environment and you wake up when you want to wake up. If you've been sleeping pretty well, but waking up in the middle of the night, you might also find that by cooling your mattress even further, toward the middle of your sleep bout, well, you'll stay in deep sleep much longer.

Although coming back to your point, I think physical activity does seem to be one of those things that is very good. And I'm remiss to have not included it in the optimization or the unconventional tips. There is a very good robust literature now demonstrating that if you are physically active during the day, you can boost the quality of your sleep, particularly your deep sleep at night. It seems to be there are some subtle differences in terms of whether you're doing aerobic versus anaerobic, so let's say, versus, you know, doing a spin-by-class for an hour versus lifting resistance, or doing resistance training for an hour or strength training, there's subtle differences, but net that overall the big picture view is that when you perform exercise, you drive a response from enhanced sleep, particularly deep sleep at night.

Make sure your bedroom evolves as a tranquil environment\\u2014keep the lights dim, and consider the mattress temperature, which should be cool enough initially and warm up as you wake up. Interestingly, having a partner in bed may disrupt sleep quality, so if that\\u2019s applicable, you might explore solutions like separate beds (Huberman Lab, \\\\\\\"GUEST SERIES | Dr. Andy Galpin,\\\\\\\" 02:13:23 - 02:14:26). \\\\n\\\\n2. **Maintain Regular Sleep Schedule**: Consistency is crucial. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends. Irregular wake times can affect your sleep quality negatively (Huberman Lab, \\\\\\\"Using Temperature To Optimize Performance, Brain & Body Health,\\\\\\\" 01:44:14 - 01:45:40). \\\\n\\\\n3. **Establish a Wind Down Routine**: Consider developing a relaxing pre-sleep routine that might include meditating, light stretching, or reading, avoiding screens right before bed as they emit blue light that can keep you awake (Huberman Lab, \\\\\\\"The Science & Practice of Perfecting Your Sleep,\\\\\\\" 02:51:40 - 02:52:47). \\\\n\\\\n4. **Limit Screen Time and Caffeine**: Reducing exposure to screens at least two hours before bedtime is advisable, as blue light impacts the circadian rhythm. Additionally, avoid caffeine particularly in the latter part of the day (Huberman Lab, \\\\\\\"GUEST SERIES | Dr. Matt Walker: Protocols to Improve Your Sleep,\\\\\\\" 00:33:28 - 00:34:36). \\\\n\\\\n5. **Manage Anxiety and Wind Down**: If you\\u2019re experiencing anxiety or insomnia, consider techniques such as breathing exercises, mental visualizations, or avoiding productivity tasks right before bed. Getting your mind off sleep can also help combat the anxiety of not sleeping (Huberman Lab, \\\\\\\"GUEST SERIES | Dr. Matt Walker: Protocols to Improve Your Sleep,\\\\\\\" 01:15:06 -
