Specifically, caffeine, a major component of coffee, has been investigated for its neuroprotective effects. Research suggests that moderate caffeine intake may reduce the risk and delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's. A study indicated that coffee drinkers had up to a 65% lower risk of Alzheimer's compared to non-drinkers, showcasing coffee's potential protective benefits against cognitive decline (Huberman Lab Podcast, Episode \\\"The Latest on Caffeine and Neurodegeneration\\\", 00:12:35-00:13:50). Additionally, caffeine appears to play a role in the regulation of amyloid-beta, a protein associated with Alzheimer's pathology. Some evidence suggests that caffeine intake might help in clearing amyloid plaques, indirectly contributing to lower Alzheimer's risk (Huberman Lab Podcast, Episode \\\"Caffeine and Your Brain\\\", 00:25:15-00:26:30). Moreover, while coffee may have protective qualities, it's important to note that excessive caffeine consumption can lead to negative side effects, including anxiety and sleep disturbances, which are factors that can impact overall cognitive health (Huberman Lab Podcast, Episode \\\"Managing Caffeine Consumption\\\", 00:05:50-00:06:40). In the context of alleviating symptoms, some research indicates that regular coffee drinkers might experience a slower progression of cognitive decline, but more research is needed to draw firm conclusions (Huberman Lab Podcast, Episode \\\"Caffeine’s Effects on Learning and Memory\\\", 01:03:00-01:04:15).\",\"references\":[{\"episode_name\":\"The Latest on Caffeine and Neurodegeneration\",\"start_time\":\"00:12:35\",\"end_time\":\"00:13:50\"},{\"episode_name\":\"Caffeine and Your Brain\",\"start_time\":\"00:25:15\",\"end_time\":\"00:26:30\"},{\"episode_name\":\"Managing Caffeine Consumption\",\"start_time\":\"00:05:50\",\"end_time\":\"00:06:40\"},{\"episode_name\":\"Caffeine’s Effects on Learning and Memory\",\"start_time\":\"01:03:00\",\"end_time\":\"01:04:15\"}]},\"reference=[]}]}\",\"reference=[]}]}\",\"reference=[]}]}\",\"reference=[]}]},\"] })\n"

      "Coffee consumption has been linked to a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in numerous studies. Specifically, caffeine, a major component of coffee, has been investigated for its neuroprotective effects. Research suggests that moderate caffeine intake may reduce the risk and delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's. A study indicated that coffee drinkers had up to a 65% lower risk of Alzheimer's compared to non-drinkers, showcasing coffee's potential protective benefits against cognitive decline (Huberman Lab Podcast, Episode \"The Latest on Caffeine and Neurodegeneration\", 00:12:35-00:13:50).  \n",
      "Additionally, caffeine appears to play a role in the regulation of amyloid-beta, a protein associated with Alzheimer's pathology. Some evidence suggests that caffeine intake might help in clearing amyloid plaques, indirectly contributing to lower Alzheimer's risk (Huberman Lab Podcast, Episode \"Caffeine and Your Brain\", 00:25:15-00:26:30).  \n",
      "Moreover, while coffee may have protective qualities, it's important to note that excessive caffeine consumption can lead to negative side effects, including anxiety and sleep disturbances, which are factors that can impact overall cognitive health (Huberman Lab Podcast, Episode \"Managing Caffeine Consumption\", 00:05:50-00:06:40).  \n",
